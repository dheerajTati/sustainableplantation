        <p>Climatic effects on plants include altered growth patterns, changes in flowering times, and shifts in 
            geographic ranges. For instance, warmer temperatures can lead to earlier flowering, while drought can 
            stress plants and affect their productivity. Additionally, increased CO2 levels can impact photosynthesis 
            and alter plant physiology.Climate change will bring more frequent and severe extreme weather events, 
            including extreme precipitation, wind disturbance, heat waves, and drought. Extreme precipitation events can 
            disturb plant growth, particularly in recently burned forests, and make plants more vulnerable to flooding 
            and soils to erosion.</p>

            <pre  style="font-size: large;font-family: 'times new roman';">Plants can be affected by various climatic conditions:

<b>Temperature:</b> Extreme heat or cold can stress plants, affect growth, and disrupt their metabolic processes.
<b>Precipitation:</b> Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to drought stress or waterlogged roots, impacting plant health.
<b>Humidity:</b> High humidity can promote fungal diseases, while low humidity can lead to water loss and stress.
<b>Wind:</b> Strong winds can damage plant structures and increase water loss through transpiration.
<b>Light:</b> Changes in sunlight availability can affect photosynthesis and flowering patterns.
<b>Frost:</b> Frost can damage plant tissues, especially in sensitive species.
<b>Snow:</b> Heavy snow can break branches and reduce access to sunlight.
<b>Hail:</b> Hailstorms can physically damage plants, affecting growth and yield.
<b>CO2 Levels:</b> Elevated carbon dioxide levels can impact plant growth and alter nutrient content.
<b>Air Pollution:</b> Pollutants like ozone can harm plant tissues and reduce growth rates.
Different plants have varying degrees of tolerance to these climatic factors, and their interactions can lead to 
complex effects on plant ecosystems.</pre>
